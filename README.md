# Syntax Coloring for Helma Skins

This is my first attempt to create a TextMate language grammar providing syntax coloring for Helma `*.skin` files.

Unfortunately, TM grammar documentation is scarce; I mainly used the following resources to achieve the goal:

- [Notes on how to create a Language Grammar and Custom Theme for a Textmate Bundle](https://benparizek.com/notebook/notes-on-how-to-create-a-language-grammar-and-custom-theme-for-a-textmate-bundle)
- VS Codeâ€™s `html.json` and `php.tmLanguage.json` files
- [Introduction to Scopes](http://blog.macromates.com/2005/introduction-to-scopes/)
- [Scope Selector Reference](http://manual.textmate.org/references.html#scope-selector)
